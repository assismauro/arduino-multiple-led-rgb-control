Using this library you can manage a group of 74HC595 CIs in a way to switch on and off each color of dozens RGB LEDs.
It takes only 3 Arduino digital ports.

The library was created based in this link information: http://www.arduino.cc/en/Hacking/Libraries.
In my blog, http://automatobr.blogspot.com.br, you can read more about that in Portuguese language.
